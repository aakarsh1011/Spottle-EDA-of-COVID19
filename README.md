# Description

This project has a prime focus on Twitter a famous social
media site. Twitter is a platform where people can send and
receive messages or “tweets” globally. Within 280 character
limits, users can share their posts which can include links to
relevant websites, videos, images, also their thoughts and
opinions on different subjects for that matter. Such huge data
can come handy to extract information and make use of it.
This particular report is for task 3 i.e Indian Sentiment
analysis after 3 lockdowns using Tweets . Sentiment analysis is
a text analysis method that detects polarity (e.g. a positive or
negative opinion) within the text, whether a whole document,
paragraph, sentence, or clause . The broader objective of the
project is to understand how to analyze twitter data, which
includes gathering the dataset, cleaning it, extracting the
required information, and drawing conclusions out of it.
